This is a problem set containing 81 coloumns. Our goal is to predict the sale price of each house (Regression)
Major Challenges:
- Too many cases of missing values <br>
- Often missing value means something. Go through data description for each thing
- Designing new features for a robust model is very time consuming. Need to have an in-depth understanding of data

To Do:<br>
- When should one-hot encoding be used? For what algorithms? <br> 
- Should label encoded features be normalized or centered atleast? <br>
- Should One-Hot encoded features be normalized or centered atleast?
- What is Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization <br>
- Research on Optimum Value for k_fold cross-validation
- What is the importance of pipeline in machine learning
- What is the importance of class and self in machine learning
- What is the difference between PCA and KernelPCA?
- How to measure the loss in useful data while doing Dimensionality Reduction
- Outlier Rectification
- Mislabled Data Identification
- Normalization of All continious variables
- Go through various kernels on Kaggle
- Use visualizations to decide between nominal and categorical variable
